    India, its population and Literacy rate!
</h1>

<h2 align="justify">
    Summary:
</h2>

<p align="justify">
    The Dataset consists of various statistics of India like the total population, the area in sq. km, male and female literacy rates, Number of districts, 
    growth rate, sex ratio etc. The dataset is originally taken from Kaggle and it is in .csv format. To make all the data parsing easy the data has been 
    converted to JSON format using python script. In the data, there are no missing values so I presume there is no need for data pre processing
</p>

<h3>
    (i) population map:
</h3>
<p align="justify">
    The population map is an Indian Map encoded based on the total population. The color encoding is chosen on the basis of the total population. The 
    lightest color indication less population and darker the color more is the population. When we hover on the Indian map a label is shown which indicates 
    the population of the corresponding state.

</p>

<h3>
    (ii) Bar Charts:
</h3>
<p align="justify">
    The bar charts are literacy charts where the upper bar chart indicates the female literacy rate of all the states and the lower chart indicates the 
    male literacy rates of all the states. When we click on a state in the map then the corresponding states literacy rates is highlighted with a pink bar 
    and all the default bars are teal and steelblue in color. 

    Above the bar charts the values of female and male literacy rates are shown dynamically where clicking a state updates the corresponding literacy rates.
</p>

<h3>
    How to use:
</h3>

<p>
    The map initially is loaded with all the populations color encoded. when we click on a map the bar charts appear showing both the male and female 
    literacy rates with only one bar highlighted in pink. Now, the charts don't dissappear and clicking the states changes the bar color. Now, bars 
    disappear only when we reload the page.
